Title: Wireshark Packet Capture and Protocol Analysis
Task: Task 5 – Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

---------------------------------------------
Objective:
---------------------------------------------
To capture live network packets on my laptop using Wireshark and identify different network protocols such as DNS, TCP, HTTP, and ICMP. 
The goal is to understand how data travels over the network and to gain practical experience in packet analysis.

---------------------------------------------
Steps Performed:
---------------------------------------------
1. Installed Wireshark from the official website.
2. Opened Wireshark and selected the active Wi-Fi network interface.
3. Started live capture by clicking the blue shark-fin icon.
4. Generated network traffic by browsing websites and pinging servers (e.g., ping google.com).
5. Stopped the capture after 1 minute.
6. Used filters like “http”, “dns”, “tcp”, and “icmp” to view specific packets.
7. Saved the capture file as “network_capture.pcap”.
8. Analyzed packet details to identify source/destination IPs and protocols.
9. Summarized the findings and exported results for submission.

---------------------------------------------
Protocols Identified:
---------------------------------------------
1. **DNS (Domain Name System)** – Used to resolve domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.
2. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** – Provides reliable data transfer between devices.
3. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** – Used for web communication between client and server.
4. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** – Used for network diagnostics (e.g., ping requests and replies).

---------------------------------------------
Sample Packet Details:
---------------------------------------------
**Packet 1: DNS Query**
Source IP: 192.168.1.4  
Destination IP: 8.8.8.8  
Protocol: DNS  
Info: Standard query 0x7bfc A www.google.com  

**Packet 2: TCP Communication**
Source IP: 192.168.1.4  
Destination IP: 142.250.183.78  
Protocol: TCP  
Info: 443 → 51532 [SYN, ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=65535  

**Packet 3: HTTP Request**
Source IP: 192.168.1.4  
Destination IP: 142.250.183.78  
Protocol: HTTP  
Info: GET /index.html HTTP/1.1  

**Packet 4: ICMP Echo Request**
Source IP: 192.168.1.4  
Destination IP: 8.8.8.8  
Protocol: ICMP  
Info: Echo (ping) request  

---------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
---------------------------------------------
Wireshark successfully captured and displayed live network traffic. 
Multiple protocols such as DNS, TCP, HTTP, and ICMP were identified and analyzed. 
This experiment enhanced understanding of how different protocols work together in real-time network communication and provided hands-on packet analysis experience.

---------------------------------------------
Outcome:
---------------------------------------------
Gained practical skills in:
- Capturing and filtering network packets
- Identifying multiple network protocols
- Analyzing packet-level communication for troubleshooting and security awareness
